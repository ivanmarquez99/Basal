# Metabolismo Basal Calculator

This is a simple web application built using Bootstrap and JavaScript to calculate the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of an individual. The BMR is the amount of energy the body needs to function while at rest, and it can help individuals determine their daily caloric needs.


## Getting Started

To get started with the application, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Then, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start using the application.

## How to Use the Application

To use the Basal Metabolism Calculator, simply enter your age, height, weight and gender into the corresponding input fields. Then click the "Calculate" button to view your estimated BMR.

The application uses the Harris-Benedict equation to calculate the BMR, which takes into account a person’s age, gender, weight and height. The results are displayed in both kCal.
